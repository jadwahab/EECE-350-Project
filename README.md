# EECE-350-Project

1) turn on the mysql server
2) update your database with the .sql file in the zipped folder
3) adjust the link of the JDBC driver according to its location on your computer
4) create new project in eclipse
5) add all the java files and the image to the source file
6) run TcpServer.java
7) run Menu.java

NB:
- Most of the code has comments so it is easy to go through
- Note that only sign in and sign up functions work on GUI. Other functions (add event, get friend list, etc.) can be implemented using the console if the function makeChoice() is uncommented from Menu.java (line 82)
